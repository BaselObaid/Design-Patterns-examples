Java Student Management System with Singleton Pattern
This Java application is a simple student management system that utilizes the Singleton design pattern for the database connection. The system includes a MySQL database connection, a Student class representing student entities, and a StudentDao class for handling database operations.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

com.designpattern.Main: The main class to run the program, demonstrating the usage of the StudentDao and StudentViewer.
com.designpattern.Student: Represents the student entity with basic attributes such as id, name, and age.
com.designpattern.StudentDao: Implements the DAO pattern to interact with the MySQL database and retrieve student data.
com.designpattern.StudentViewer: Provides a simple method to print a list of students to the console.
com.designpattern.DataBaseConnection: Singleton class for establishing a connection to the MySQL database.
Singleton Design Pattern
The Singleton pattern is implemented in the DataBaseConnection class:

Private Constructor:

java
Copy code
private DataBaseConnection() {
    // Constructor code
}
The constructor is private, preventing external instantiation of the class.

Static Instance:

java
Copy code
private static volatile DataBaseConnection dataBaseConnection;
The class contains a static instance of itself.

Static Factory Method (getInstance):

java
Copy code
public static DataBaseConnection getInstance() {
    if (dataBaseConnection == null) {
        synchronized (DataBaseConnection.class) {
            if (dataBaseConnection == null) {
                dataBaseConnection = new DataBaseConnection();
            }
        }
    }
    return dataBaseConnection;
}
The getInstance method ensures only one instance of the class is created and provides a global point of access.

Setup
Database Configuration:

Ensure you have a MySQL server running.
Modify the DataBaseConnection class with your database URL, username, and password.
Dependencies:

This project uses JDBC for database connectivity. Ensure the JDBC driver is added to your project.
Run the Application:

Execute the Main class to run the program.
The program will retrieve student data from the database and print it to the console.
